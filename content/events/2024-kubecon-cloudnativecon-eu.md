description = "Follow us from Barcelona, Spain (for Wasm I/O the week before) and meet us in Paris, France for the next KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU '24! We love getting back to our roots (several of us have been going to KubeCon since the first one in '15) and gathering with the cloud native community. We have some cool stuff brewing so swing by the Fermyon booth to learn more about what we're building in the Wasm + Kubernetes/Cloud Native world!"
