Spin is a framework for building and running event-driven microservice applications with WebAssembly (Wasm) components.

Spin uses Wasm because it is **sandboxed, portable, and fast**.  Millisecond cold start times mean no need to keep applications "warm".

Many languages have Wasm implementations, so **developers don't have to learn new languages or libraries**.

Spin is **open source** and **built on standards**, meaning you can take your Spin applications anywhere.  There are Spin implementations for local development, for self-hosted servers, for Kubernetes, and for cloud-hosted services.
